### Installation

#### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18.x or higher
- npm 8.x or higher

#### Local Development
\`\`\`bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd vea-2025-portal

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your configuration

# Start development server
npm run dev
\`\`\`

#### Troubleshooting

- **"Autoprefixer is not installed" warning** – install the PostCSS plugin locally so vendor prefixes are generated automatically:

  ```bash
  npm install --save-dev autoprefixer
  ```

- **`_next/static` assets return 404 in production** – this happens when the hashed build artifacts generated by `next build` are
  missing on the server. In standalone deployments you must upload both `.next/standalone` (the Node server) **and**
  `.next/static` (all CSS/JS chunks referenced in the HTML). If only the standalone folder is deployed, or if an older build is
  still cached in the browser/CDN, the page will request files such as
  `/_next/static/chunks/main-app-0d0687b509516b31.js` that no longer exist and the browser logs repeated `net::ERR_ABORTED 404`
  errors. Redeploy the current `.next/static` directory (or clear the CDN cache) together with the server bundle to restore the
  missing assets.

#### Production Deployment
\`\`\`bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start

# Or use Docker
docker-compose up -d
\`\`\`

### Optional: Downloading Brand Fonts Locally
The project now falls back to system fonts by default so that `npm run build` works without internet access. If you want to keep the original Inter and Playfair Display typography, download the variable font files directly into `public/fonts`:

```
mkdir -p public/fonts

# Inter (variable slant/weight)
curl -L -o public/fonts/Inter-VariableFont_slnt,wght.ttf \
  https://github.com/google/fonts/raw/main/ofl/inter/Inter-VariableFont_slnt,wght.ttf

# Playfair Display (variable weight)
curl -L -o public/fonts/PlayfairDisplay-VariableFont_wght.ttf \
  https://github.com/google/fonts/raw/main/ofl/playfairdisplay/PlayfairDisplay-VariableFont_wght.ttf
```

After downloading the files, the browser will automatically load them from `/fonts` if available.
