# VEA 2025 Portal - cPanel Node.js Deployment Guide

This guide walks you through running the full Next.js application (including all API routes and dynamic features) on a cPanel host that supports Node.js applications.

## 🚀 Prepare the production build locally

1. **Install dependencies and build the standalone bundle**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run deploy:server
   ```

   The `deploy:server` script runs `next build` and produces a standalone Node.js server inside `.next/standalone` together with the required static assets in `.next/static`.

2. **Package the deployment artifacts**
   Create an archive containing the following paths from your project root:
   - `.next/standalone/` (entire folder)
   - `.next/static/` (entire folder)
   - `public/` (entire folder)
   - `package.json` and `package-lock.json`
   - `server.js`
   - `.env.production` (or copy of `.env.example` configured for production)

   > Tip: run `./deploy.sh` to automatically build the project and generate `vea-portal-node-deployment.zip` with these contents.

## 📁 Upload files to cPanel

1. Open the cPanel **File Manager** (or use SFTP).
2. Navigate to `public_html/portal.victoryeducationalacademy.com.ng/` (or the directory configured for your Node.js app).
3. Upload the archive created in the previous step and extract it.
4. Verify the extracted structure looks like:
   ```
   public_html/portal.victoryeducationalacademy.com.ng/
   ├── .next/
   │   ├── standalone/
   │   └── static/
   ├── public/
   ├── package.json
   ├── package-lock.json
   ├── server.js
   └── .env.production
   ```

## ⚙️ Configure the cPanel Node.js application

1. **Create / edit the Node.js app** in cPanel:
   - Select Node.js 18 or higher.
   - Set the application root to `public_html/portal.victoryeducationalacademy.com.ng`.
   - Set the startup file to `server.js`.
   - Set the application mode to **Production**.

2. **Install production dependencies** from the app terminal:
   ```bash
   cd ~/public_html/portal.victoryeducationalacademy.com.ng
   npm install --omit=dev
   ```

3. **Define environment variables** in the cPanel interface (see list below).

4. **Restart** the Node.js application to apply the new build.

## 🌐 Point the public domain at the Node.js app

The Node.js process continues to listen on port `3000`, but the public domain
(`portal.victoryeducationalacademy.com.ng`) should answer on the standard HTTP
ports `80`/`443`. Configure a reverse proxy so that requests on the public
domain are forwarded to the application port:

### Option A – nginx (recommended)

1. Install nginx on the server or use the nginx container from
   `docker-compose.yml`.
2. Copy `nginx.conf` from this repository to `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` (or the
   appropriate include directory). The configuration already forwards
   `portal.victoryeducationalacademy.com.ng` to the Node.js app.
3. If you are running the Node.js app directly on the host instead of Docker,
   edit the `upstream vea-portal` block and replace `vea-portal:3000` with
   `127.0.0.1:3000` (or the port configured in your Node.js app).
4. Reload nginx: `sudo nginx -s reload`.

### Option B – Apache (cPanel proxy)

If nginx is not available, enable the cPanel **Application Manager** proxy for
the domain and point it at the internal Node.js port (typically `3000`). cPanel
will automatically create the required Apache reverse proxy rules.

## 🛠 Ongoing maintenance

- Re-run `npm run deploy:server` before every release and upload the fresh `.next` and `public` folders.
- After each deployment, restart the Node.js application from the cPanel dashboard.
- Use the cPanel “Run JS Script” console to tail logs or clear the `.next/cache` directory if you ever need to invalidate cached pages.
